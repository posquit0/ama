Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

## Guidelines

- :mag: Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- :memo: Use a succinct title and description.
- :bug: Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- :signal_strength: Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- :blush: Be nice, civil and polite.
- :heart_eyes: If you include at least one emoji in your question, the feedback will probably come faster.
